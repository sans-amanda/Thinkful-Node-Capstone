FROM APP IDEA TO USER STORIES

- Brainstorm Idea:
  - Anxiety, stress
  - Group advice
  - Support for small and big problems
  - App for people to write/record what is bothering them.

- Define You App's Purpose:
  - Give users a more concrete/tangible way of deal with mental stress and anxiety.
  - Allow other users to interact with advice, helpful encourgment, etc.
  - Create a judgement-free space to LET THAT SHIT GO.
  - Anonymously post and interact with other users.
  - Community confessional/diary/journal.
  - Should feel living/breathing, like a collective consciousness. 
  - Users anonymous, and should not be able to differentiate between mine and other's posts.

- Write Your App Idea Down:
  - App allows users to post and interact (anonymously) with problems or anxieties they are thinking/feeling. When they are "resolved", users can erase them from the archive to help "let go".
